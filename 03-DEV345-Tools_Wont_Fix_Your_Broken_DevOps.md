# DEV345 - Tools Wonâ€™t Fix Your Broken DevOps

* Water Scrum Fall is the general way lots of organizations do
  * Dev part (scrum) is more efficent but doesn't effect the overall delivery, its not a force multipler as if everything was doing

* Amazon continuous deployment, but it took 4 years of investment to get ther
  * Some paper on this to look up
* DevOps Movement
  * Cross functional community of practice deicated to the sduy of building, evolving, and operating raidly chaning, secure, reslient systems at scale

* Looking for the abstraction of what works in a general way to avoid the "it won't work for my team" approach
  * Study with 23k data points with various size, all around the world

* Does DevIos actually help?
  * Software delivery performance matters - firms with high-performing IT organizations were twice as likely to exceed their profitability, market share and productivity goals
  * Not just for, for profit companys/money related. Also matches into
    * Quality of goods and services
    * operating efficenty
    * Customer satisfaction
    * Wuality of priducts or services
    * Achieving organization or mission goals

* Delivery Perofrmance
  * Lead time for changes
  * Release frequency
  * Time to restore service
  * Change fail rate

* Categorigization -  High, medium, low (we are basically a low performing team)
  * How to move?
    * Technology (tooling & automation)
    * Management practices
    * Culture
  * Relies on all 3 working together - you need all 3 to see returns

* Continuous Delivery
  * What it is:
    * effective test data management
    * Comprehensive fast and reliable test and deployment automation
    * trunk-based development and continous integration
    * Application code and app & system configuration all in version control
    * Incorperation security (and securiyt teams) into the delivery processs
  * Leads to
    * less rework
    * lower levels of deployment pain
    * generative, performce-oriented culture (per Westrum's mdoel)
    * Higher levels of IT performance ( higher throughput and stability)
    * Identifying strongly with the oraganization you work for
    * Lower change fail rates

* Quality
  * New work vs unplanned work or rework
    * The reason you are going slowly is that you are spending time to do things like rework

* Change Management
  * Change management boards don't work
  * Ways
    * All production changes must be approved by an external body before deployment or implementation
      * negatively correlated with IT performance
      * slows speed with revie
      * No positive stability 
    * We have no change approval process
      * Better than having an external body
    * We rely on peer review to manage changes
      * This is the best method
      * segredation of duties best done upstream in small bits

* Management
  * Managing WIP is important, right?
  * Nope
  * Lean Management
    * What?
      * Effective WIP limits that drive process improvement
      * Use of visual displays to monitor quality, productivity and work in progress
      * Use of app perf and infra monintioring otols to make buisness decisions
    * Leads to
      * generative performance-oriented culture (per Westrum's model)
      * Higher level of IT performance (higher and throughput and stability)
      * lower levels of burnout

* Structured equation model as a way to do the analysis
  * Optimize dependent variable
  * Good for exploratory work
  * Does not need normally distributed data

* Product Management SEM
  * What is it?
    * Working in small batches and use of MVPs
    * Visibility into the flow of work across the value stream
    * Seeking - and action on - feedback from customers
    * Giving teams the authoirty to create and change specs
  * Evaluating well designed and executed dperimenta that were designed to improve a dkey metric, only about 1/3 were successful at improving the key metric - Online Experimentation at Microsoft Kohavi et all stanford.io/130uW6X
  * Everyone should have the ability to experiment - Greg Linden glinden.blogspot.com/2006/04/early-amazon-shopping-cart.html

* Culture
  * High-trust culture
    * Patheological (power oriented)
      * Low cooperation
      * Messengers shot
      * Responsibilities shirked
      * Bridging discouraged
      * Failure leads to scapegoating
      * Novelty crushed
    * Beureaucratic (rule oriented)
      * Modest cooperation
      * Messengers neglected
      * Narrow responsibilities
      * Bridging tolerated
      * Failutre leads to justice
      * Novelty leads to problems
    * Generative (performance oriented)
      * High cooperation
      * Messengers trained
      * Risks are shared
      * Bridging encouraged
      * Failure leads to enquiry
      * Novelty implemented
  * Likert-type Scale to study this
* Effective teams
  * https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team
  1) Pycological safety (feel safe to take risks)
  2) Dependability (on time with high quality)
  3) Structure and Clarity (clear roles for team members)
  4) Meaning (work is personally meaningful)
  5) Impact (work matters)

* Dealing with Failure
  * In a complex, adaptive system, failure is inevitable
  * When accidents happen, human error is the starting point of a blameless post-mortem
  * Ask: How can we get people better infromation?
  * Ask: How can we detecte and limit failure modes?
* The field guid to understaning 'human error' Sidney Dekker
* Etsy gives out a three armed sweater to the person who has caused the biggest production failure
* Is there a "how can I help?"" attitude or a "whose falut is it?" attitude
* Disaster recovery testing
  * DiRT tests
